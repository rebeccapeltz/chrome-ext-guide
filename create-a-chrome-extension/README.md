# Create a Chrome Extension

We'll follow the design and creation of an extension named **Link Reveal**.  It will be activated by clicking an icon to the right of the Chrome address bar.  The red hook is the icon associated with this extension.

<div data-full-width="false">

</div>

When the user clicks on the icon, this triggers an action that results in a popup window displayed with the **Link Reveal** report of all the links in the current web page.

Creating a Chrome extension starts with understanding the requirements that files containing code and configuration must meet.  Knowing how Chrome communicates between the user web page and the extension web page is essential. &#x20;
